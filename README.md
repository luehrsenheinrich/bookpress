# Bookpress
The wordpress theme to manage facebook page tabs

## Mission Statement
Let's be honest, creating Facebook Page Tabs is **a pain in the ass**! Either you are forced to use one of the major service providers, like HIKE or Wildfire, or some overpriced programmer charges you to build a single page with backend, fairytales and prince charming.
As a wordpress engeneer I know that building webpages (and facebook page tabs) can be easy doesn't have to be expensive. With a little bit of knowledge and code you can build awesome stuff.

This Wordpress theme wants to make that possible! In this theme we are trying to combine a standard set of styles and functions, that get you up and running in no time.

* You're doing a page-tab for a customer with custom CSS? No problem, just paste your styles in the according field!
* You want to do a mail in contest and all the services are expensive as hell? Well, just install one of the countless contact form plugins for Wordpress.

## What do I need?
The greatest difference from a [standard wordpress install](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) is the fact that you'll need an **SSL certificate** to please facebook. We also recommend to install Wordpress with the SSL Path (https://your-install-domain.com) as base path.

Besides that, just install this theme into the "wp-content/themes" folder of your wordpress install and you're good to go.

## Colophon
This theme is made possible by some awesome projects and even more awesome programmers! This is the space to praise them.

### [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
The *Twitter Bootstrap* provides a basic layout and user interface elements for Bookpress.

### [The LESS PHP Compiler](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp)
LESS CSS makes it terribly easy to write very advanced styles with only a few lines of codes. Not only helps the built in PHP LESS Compiler, written by Leaf Corcoran, in development, it also compiles the LESS code entered by the user and (more or less) validates the custom CSS.

### [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
Originally written for the Twitter Bootstrap, but I couldn't wait until it was implemented. The name says it all, it's an awesome font. (For icons.)
